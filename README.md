#Audio-Forensics
Abstract:

This project demonstrates the application of audio forensics to match a suspect's voice sample with recordings from various calls. The technique uses Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) to extract unique voice features and computes cosine similarity to assess the likelihood of a match. This process aids in identifying if a suspect's voice matches the one present in evidence recordings, leveraging open-source tools like librosa and scipy.

Features

-Extracts MFCC features from audio samples.

-Computes similarity scores using cosine similarity.

-Processes multiple audio files efficiently.

-Provides an automated and reproducible workflow for voice matching.
