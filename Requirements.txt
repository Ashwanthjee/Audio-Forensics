Usage
 1. Clone the repository:
	git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/audio-forensics.git
	cd audio-forensics
 2. Place Audio Files:
	-> Add the suspect's voice sample as suspect_sample.wav to the audio_samples/ folder.
	-> Add call recordings as call_recording1.wav, call_recording2.wav, etc., to the same folder.
 3. Run the Program:
	python audio_matcher.py




SAMPLE OUPUT:

MFCC for suspect file (suspect_sample.wav):
[ 12.34, -8.91, 5.12, ... ]

Cosine Similarity between suspect and call 1 (call_recording1.wav): 0.89
Cosine Similarity between suspect and call 2 (call_recording2.wav): 0.76
